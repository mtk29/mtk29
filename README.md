# Matthew Karenbauer ðŸ˜Ž

I am a senior Computer Science major at Penn State Behrend.

  - A favorite hobby of mine is practicing and playing the guitar (bass guitar as well).
  - I hadn't started coding until I got to college, but have enjoyed studying computer science ever since.
  - I really like machine learning and artificial intelligence.
  - Python, Javascript, and C++ are some of the languages I like most.
